# A2 Genetic Algorithms

# Your readme should include the following information. Each student needs to submit all of this information themselves, even when pair programming. 

Group Members: Emily, Ari


Any peers and/or TAs/Tutors you collaborated with: Rachel, Huda, Ari, Zoe F, Jessica


Would you like to give "kudos" to anyone who was particularly supportive or helpful? 

    - I worked on this project with Ari, and went to TA hours, where Jessica helped me (And Ari worked with Rachel and Huda)


Cite any references used: None


Brief summary of what you observed about the "winners" produced by your genetic algorithm. Did changing the parameter values have any effect on what you observed?

    - I observed that the "winners" produced by the genetic algorithm had similar chromosome letters and were rather short. Changing the parameter values meant that the letters would start to repeat.


Reflection on your experience with this assignment-- what was interesting? what was hard? what do you feel like you learned?


    - I found it hard to make a start on the coding especially due to the loops, but the algorithm was interesting for how it was implemented. I learned how to organize my planning a bit better, and learned that I could write down something like a prototype on whiteboards and turn it into code slowly.
